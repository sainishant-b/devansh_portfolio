# Smart Warehouse – RFID & Predictive Tracking

Smart Warehouse is a conceptual IoT + analytics system designed to automate warehouse inventory management using **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** for real-time item tracking and **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for forecasting stock demand and trends. By combining RFID’s automatic identification capabilities with time-series analytics, the system aims to optimize stock levels, reduce manual errors, and support proactive restocking decisions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
