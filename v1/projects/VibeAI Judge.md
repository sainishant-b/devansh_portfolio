# Vibe-AI Judge

Vibe-AI Judge is a frontend project scaffolded using **Lovable.dev**, featuring a React + Vite codebase styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn-UI**. It serves as a foundation for building an AI “vibe judge” interface or UI dashboard where users can extend functionality — for example, integrating LLM-powered evaluation components in future iterations.  
The repository includes project setup scripts, UI components, and instant preview capabilities via `npm run dev`. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
